## Project Purpose

IX-Shimizu is an open-source system designed to remove oil and oil-based chemicals from marine environments using real-world, buildable, non-chemical remediation methods. It is built exclusively for ecological protection purposes.

---

## International Compliance Framework

This system is designed to align with the following international environmental standards and regulations:

- **MARPOL 73/78 (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships)**  
  - Specifically Annex I: Prevention of Oil Pollution

- **OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic**

- **United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**  
  - Clean Water Act Compliance  
  - Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA)

- **European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)**  
  - Descriptor 8: Concentrations of Contaminants (Oil Removal Focus)

---

## System Design Compliance Notes

- **No Chemical Dispersants**:  
  IX-Shimizu does not rely on chemical additives or dispersants, which are restricted or prohibited under certain regulations.

- **Non-Destructive Marine Life Interaction**:  
  All mechanical and magnetic systems are designed with mesh shielding and flow rate limits that prevent harm to aquatic species.

- **Zero Harmful Return Policy**:  
  Oil and oil-capture materials are fully retained within the system and removed from marine environments, complying with closed-loop cleanup standards.

## Operator Compliance Responsibility

Deploying entities must:

- Ensure system configuration is aligned with local maritime authority requirements.
- Register IX-Shimizu units if required under territorial marine equipment registries.
- Maintain accurate deployment logs and oil removal data in case of audit.

---

## Disclaimer

IX-Shimizu provides no legal guarantees for automatic compliance in all jurisdictions. It is the responsibility of the deploying organization or individual to verify local regulatory compatibility before activation.
