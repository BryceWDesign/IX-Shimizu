## Purpose

This document outlines the projected environmental impact of deploying IX-Shimizu systems for oil and chemical remediation in marine environments.

---

## 1. Primary Environmental Objectives

- Remove oil and oil-based chemical contaminants from ocean water without reintroducing harmful substances.
- Operate without introducing secondary pollutants, microplastics, or chemical treatment agents.
- Preserve local aquatic lifeforms, flora, and fauna integrity.

## 2. System Components and Environmental Risk Review

| Component              | Material               | Environmental Risk Profile |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Sponge Filtration     | Open-cell polyurethane | Zero-leach, non-toxic     |
| Nanoparticle System   | Iron Oxide, Carbon-based | Non-toxic, fully reclaimable |
| Frame Structure       | Marine-grade aluminum or HDPE | Long-term inert          |
| Battery System        | LiFePO₄                | Low-risk chemistry, no cobalt |
| Control Electronics   | Industrial Marine IP68 | Contained, no fluid leakage  |

---

## 3. Chemical Leakage Risk

- **Nanoparticles:**  
  - Fully encapsulated during operation  
  - Reclaimed through closed-loop centrifuge system  

- **Filtration Media:**  
  - Sponge material rated for marine-safe deployment  
  - No degradation particles under normal use  

- **Power System:**  
  - LiFePO₄ chemistry specifically chosen to avoid thermal runaway risks  
  - All batteries enclosed in sealed, impact-resistant casings

## 4. System Lifecycle Assessment

| Stage               | Environmental Impact Summary |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Manufacturing      | Moderate (aluminum, electronics) |
| Operation          | Net Positive (removes oil, zero discharge) |
| End-of-Life        | Components fully reclaimable or recyclable |

---

## 5. Regulatory Compliance Notes

- IX-Shimizu components comply with:
  - MARPOL Annex I (Oil Pollution Prevention)
  - REACH (EU Chemicals Regulation)
  - RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances)
  - WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive)

- Final operator responsibility to confirm local jurisdictional requirements.

## 6. Ethical and Sustainability Statement

IX-Shimizu is developed under strict non-military, non-weaponized, civilian-use terms. The primary design objective is ecological restoration and marine ecosystem protection.
