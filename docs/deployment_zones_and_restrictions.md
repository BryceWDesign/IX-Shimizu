## Purpose

This document outlines recommended and restricted deployment zones for the IX-Shimizu oil extraction and purification system, based on legal, ecological, and operational considerations.

---

## 1. Recommended Deployment Zones

### a. Coastal Marine Environments
- Distance: 1–20 nautical miles offshore
- Conditions: Moderate wave activity, stable currents
- Target Scenario: Oil spill remediation, industrial discharge cleanup

### b. Open Ocean Zones
- Distance: > 20 nautical miles offshore
- Conditions: Stronger currents and weather variability
- Target Scenario: Large-scale oil spill events, environmental protection reserves

### c. Port and Harbor Areas (With Caution)
- Conditions: Lower water volume, higher contamination complexity
- Target Scenario: Localized contamination events near industrial facilities

## 2. Deployment Restrictions

| Zone Type                    | Status           | Notes                                           |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)| Restricted       | Deploy only with explicit authorization         |
| Coral Reef Systems           | Avoid            | Risk of physical disruption                      |
| Shallow Water Ecosystems     | Caution          | Avoid mechanical disturbance to seabed habitats |
| Military Maritime Zones      | Restricted       | Requires special clearance                      |
| Polar Regions                | Experimental     | Confirm cold-weather system adaptations first   |

## 3. Legal Compliance Reminder

Deploying IX-Shimizu units in any territorial waters requires verification of local, national, and international maritime laws.

- **Do Not Deploy Without Authorization:**  
  In jurisdictions requiring environmental system registry or approval.

- **Operator Responsibility:**  
  All legal consequences, fines, or regulatory actions fall to the deploying party, not the repository author or contributors.

---

## 4. Deployment Recordkeeping

Operators must maintain logs including:

- Deployment coordinates (latitude/longitude)
- Date and time stamps
- Purpose of deployment
- Recovery dates (if applicable)

---

## 5. Technical Limitations by Zone

- **Wave Height Limit:** 4–6 meters operational max
- **Temperature Range:** −10°C to +50°C without additional adaptations
- **Water Depth Minimum:** 2 meters to avoid grounding risk
