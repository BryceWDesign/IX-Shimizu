This document provides a detailed operational maintenance and regeneration timeline for optimal IX-Shimizu system performance.

---

## 1. Daily Maintenance Tasks

- Visual inspection of system integrity if docked or visible.
- Review telemetry logs for abnormal readings:
  - Oil PPM above warning threshold
  - Battery SOC below recovery trigger
  - Unexpected shutdown events

---

## 2. Weekly Maintenance Tasks

- Conduct manual calibration check of oil PPM sensor(s).
- Wipe and clean external housing if deployed in high-particulate zones.
- Review sponge compression system operation cycles via control logs.

---

## 3. Monthly Maintenance Tasks

- Full recalibration of oil PPM, turbidity, and flow sensors.
- Verify magnet array field strength (portable Gauss meter recommended).
- Battery bank health check:
  - Voltage consistency test
  - Physical inspection (if accessible)

## 4. Nanoparticle System Regeneration

| Action                        | Frequency          |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Regeneration Centrifuge Run   | Every 10 full cycles |
| Complete Nanoparticle Replacement | Every 120 days (or earlier if PPM levels degrade) |

---

## 5. Sponge System Regeneration & Replacement

| Action                            | Frequency                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Sponge Compression/Draining Cycle | After each oil capture session |
| Full Sponge Module Replacement    | Every 50 regeneration cycles or when absorption falls below 80% of baseline |

---

## 6. Bi-Annual System Overhaul Tasks

- Remove IX-Shimizu unit from deployment zone (if feasible).
- Full internal inspection:
  - Frame integrity
  - Housing seal condition
  - Electrical system waterproofing
- Firmware/software update and reflash (if applicable).
- Battery bank capacity re-certification.

---

## 7. Long-Term Lifecycle Notes

- Magnet array lifespan: Estimated 10 years under marine conditions.
- Structural frame lifespan: Estimated 15–20 years HDPE/Aluminum marine rated.
- Solar/Wave system lifespan: 8–12 years depending on exposure.
