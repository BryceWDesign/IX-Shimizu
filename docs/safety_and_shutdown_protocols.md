## Purpose

This document defines critical safety behaviors, automatic shutdown logic, and manual override procedures for IX-Shimizu environmental deployment scenarios.

---

## 1. Automated System Shutdown Triggers

| Trigger Condition           | System Response                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Oil PPM > `OIL_PPM_MAX_LEVEL` | Suspend dosing, engage full capture array |
| Battery SOC < `BATTERY_SOC_CRITICAL_LEVEL` | Switch to low-power safe mode, cease all capture activities |
| Turbidity > `TURBIDITY_MAX_LEVEL` | Engage mechanical purge cycle, halt nanoparticle dosing |
| Sensor Health Failure      | Suspend all active subsystems except monitoring |
| PLC Communication Loss     | Hardware failsafe triggers full system halt |

All thresholds defined in `/src/config/system_constants.py`.

## 2. Manual Shutdown Procedure

If direct human intervention is required:

1. Engage physical shutdown button or pull switch on unit (IP68-rated enclosure).
2. Disconnect ambient energy input via main breaker switch.
3. Verify complete power loss via voltage readout panel or diagnostic port.

## 3. Emergency Maintenance Protocol

- **Oil Spill Overload Situation:**  
  If oil volume exceeds unit capture capacity, deploy secondary IX-Shimizu units or auxiliary oil boom systems.

- **Mechanical Damage:**  
  If structural failure occurs, recover unit for repair. Do not attempt in-field mechanical fixes beyond sponge module swaps.

- **Battery Fire or Overheat:**  
  Follow standard LiFePOâ‚„ marine battery fire protocols:
  - Saltwater immersion NOT recommended (contrary to standard Li-ion response).
  - Use Class D extinguishing agents.

---

## 4. Sensor Calibration Failures

- If oil PPM sensor reports impossible values (e.g., negative ppm):
  - Immediately suspend nanoparticle dosing
  - Engage sponge-only passive mode
  - Recalibrate sensor as outlined in `/docs/system_calibration_procedures.md`

---

## 5. Communication Blackout Response

- If telemetry fails and no remote commands are received:
  - System automatically enters autonomous safe mode within 60 minutes
  - Resumes normal operation once communication is restored OR battery SOC recovers past warning threshold

---

## 6. End-of-Life Decommissioning

- Recover all IX-Shimizu hardware from marine deployment
- Properly dispose or recycle:
  - Nanoparticles via hazardous waste handling
  - Sponge modules via certified disposal streams
  - Structural components per local marine debris regulations
