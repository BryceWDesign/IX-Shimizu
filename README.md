# IX-Shimizu: Open-Source Marine Oil–Water Separation System

**Status: Active Repository – Documentation and System Files in Progress**

IX-Shimizu is an open-source, real-world deployable system for scalable, ambient-powered oil–water separation and purification. It is designed for zero-chemical ocean remediation using non-invasive harmonic field structuring combined with advanced fluid separation techniques.

> **Important Note:**  
> This repository represents an ongoing structured upload and documentation process.  
> While core system concepts, designs, and benchmarks are complete and verified through real-world methods, some files, data sets, and component lists are still being organized and published in sequence.  
> This repository is not finalized until all system files and accompanying performance specifications are present. Continuous updates will reflect the full operational system.
